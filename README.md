Pretty Print for Gmail
----------------
Pretty print Gmail emails. [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pretty-print-gmail/gdanfldekhdgkbmdoeapbgbcpfglkflg).    

Once installed, open up the email thread you want to print, and press `Alt + P`. That's it. You'll get a print view devoid of annoying Gmail logos, sender/receiver information, etc.

Alternatively, if you hate shortcuts, click on the orange printer button next to the address bar to print.

If you want to pretty print a single email in a thread ([from Gmail Help](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/8255?hl=en)): 

- Open the message you want to print
- Click the down arrow next to the reply button, at the top-right corner of the message
- Select Print. The extension cleans this up too.

I also wrote a [blog post](http://shivankaul.com/blog/2015/06/10/pretty-print-gmail.html) about it.

Merci beaucoup.
