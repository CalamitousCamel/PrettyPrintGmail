## Features and Usage

### Multiple Printing
From the main Gmail page, select all the emails you want to print, and press the extension icon ![orange printer](/extension/assets/icon-16.png?raw=true "extension icon"). Alternatively, you can press <kbd>Alt + P</kbd> (extension shortcut), but if that is overriden by something else then it won't work.

  <p align="center"><sub>Select multiple emails from the main Gmail page and press extension icon</sub></p>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/screenshots/screenshot-multiple-printing-after.png"/>
  <p align="center"><sub>All of them are combined in a print view</sub></p>
</p>

Print as many emails as you like! You can print by label, category, etc. 

If you select too many emails to print, things might slow down for a bit - please be patient!

### Single Thread Printing
If you want to pretty print one thread, click on the email thread. Now press the extension icon ![orange printer](/extension/assets/icon-16.png?raw=true "extension icon") or the shortcut <kbd>Alt + P</kbd>. 

### Single Email in Thread Printing
If you want to pretty print a **single message** in a long threaded conversation, then this extension supports that as well! Custom styles are inserted for the to-be-printed email. Do the following:

- Open the message you want to print
- Click the down arrow next to the reply button, at the top-right corner of the message
- Select Print. The email should be all cleaned up!

This project (especially the multiple printing feature) took (takes) a ridiculous amount of time and effort to develop. Your donations help me devote time to features/bug-fixes by having to spend less time earning money to buy oatmeal. Because oatmeal is the best. Oatmeal + yogurt + berries + banana + flaxseed + peanut butter. You're welcome.

### Known Bugs
If you have inline images in your emails, they might not be loaded correctly because the cleaned up emails are inserted into a new printing page and this may violate the same-origin policy. I'm working on this - in case there is active interest in solving this issue, I'll work on this, well, more (so please let me know!).
