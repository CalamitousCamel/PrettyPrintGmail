Pretty print Gmail emails. [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pretty-print-gmail/gdanfldekhdgkbmdoeapbgbcpfglkflg). Get rid of that clunky Gmail logo and other visual clutter while printing tickets, etc.

## Features and Usage

### Multiple Printing
From the main Gmail page, select all the emails you want to print, and press the orange printer extension icon. Alternatively, you can press <kbd>Alt + P</kbd> (extension shortcut), but if something is already using that as a shortcut on your computer then it will not work. Print as many emails as you like! If you select too many emails to print, things might slow down for a bit -- please be patient! All the selected emails are compiled into one printing page, and network requests have to be made for each selected thread. 

### Single Thread Printing
If you want to pretty print one thread, click on the email. Now press the extension icon / <kbd>Alt + P</kbd>. 

If you want to pretty print a **single message** in a long threaded conversation, then this extension supports that as well! Custom styles are inserted for the to-be-printed email. Do the following:

- Open the message you want to print
- Click the down arrow next to the reply button, at the top-right corner of the message
- Select Print. The email should be all cleaned up!

### Installation
Simply head on over to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pretty-print-gmail/gdanfldekhdgkbmdoeapbgbcpfglkflg) and install it. 

### Requirements
Just Google Chrome! Isn't the monopolized internet amazing.

### Known Bugs
If you have inline images in your emails, they might not be loaded correctly because the cleaned up emails are inserted into a new printing page, so the images won't load because of the same-origin policy. I'm working on this -- in case there is active interest in solving this, I'll work on this more.
