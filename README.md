Wouldn't you rather it gave you a nice, clean print view of your emails, the way you deserve?

## Features and Usage

### Multiple Printing
From the main Gmail page, select all the emails you want to print, and press the extension icon ![orange printer](/extension/assets/icon-16.png?raw=true "extension icon"). Alternatively, you can press <kbd>Alt + P</kbd> (extension shortcut), but if that is overriden by something else then it won't work. 

Print as many emails as you like! You can print by label, category, etc. 

If you select too many emails to print, things might slow down for a bit - please be patient!

### Single Thread Printing
If you want to pretty print one thread, click on the email. Now press the extension icon ![orange printer](/extension/assets/icon-16.png?raw=true "extension icon") or the shortcut <kbd>Alt + P</kbd>. 

If you want to pretty print a **single message** in a long threaded conversation, then this extension supports that as well! Custom styles are inserted for the to-be-printed email. Do the following:

- Open the message you want to print
- Click the down arrow next to the reply button, at the top-right corner of the message
- Select Print. The email should be all cleaned up!

### Installation
Simply head on over to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pretty-print-gmail/gdanfldekhdgkbmdoeapbgbcpfglkflg) and install it. 

### Requirements
Just Google Chrome! Isn't the monopolized internet amazing.

### Known Bugs
If you have inline images in your emails, they might not be loaded correctly because the cleaned up emails are inserted into a new printing page and this may violate the same-origin policy. I'm working on this - in case there is active interest in solving this issue, I'll work on this, well, more (so please let me know!).
